# 🧠 Option Strategy Visualizer

Explore, visualize, and understand the payoff of custom option strategies built from basic Calls and Puts (Long/Short).  
This tool is perfect for learning, teaching, or prototyping strategies in computational finance.

## 📘 How It Works

[Check the full project]([https://www.youtube.com/@Markh4ck](https://www.markaliaga.com/projects/option-strategy-visualizer))  


This Python script generates all valid combinations of options (Calls and Puts, Long and Short) and lets you:

- View all possible strategy combinations of N options
- Select one by index
- Instantly see its payoff graph

You can define how many options you want per strategy (`2`, `3`, etc.) and explore hundreds of combinations with one input.
